1. Core Architecture
LLM Foundation: Use a base model like GPT-4, Llama 3, or Claude 3 for natural language understanding
Medical Knowledge Layer: Integrate:
Structured Databases:
Drug databases (e.g., RxNorm, DailyMed)
Disease-symptom mappings (e.g., Human Phenotype Ontology)
Ayurvedic knowledge base (e.g., from classical texts like Charaka Samhita)
Medical APIs:
IBM Micromedex
Mayo Clinic API
Ayurvedic APIs like NAMSA (National Ayurvedic Medical Database)
2. Key Features Implementation
Symptom Analysis:

# Pseudocode for symptom processing
def analyze_symptoms(user_input):
    entities = medical_ner.extract(user_input)  # Extract symptoms/duration
    possible_conditions = knowledge_base.match(entities)
    return {
        "likely_conditions": rank_conditions(possible_conditions),
        "confidence_scores": calculate_confidence(possible_conditions)
    }
Treatment Recommendations:
Conventional Medicine:
Suggest FDA-approved drugs with dosage ranges
Include contraindications and side effects
Ayurvedic Module:

        "lifestyle": ayurveda_db.get_dinacharya(condition),
        "panchakarma": ayurveda_db.get_therapies(condition)
    }
Test Recommendations:
Suggest lab tests/imaging based on symptom patterns
Include urgency indicators (e.g., "Immediate", "Within 48 hours")
3. Safety & Compliance Framework
Critical Safeguards:
Disclaimer Injection:
"This is not medical advice. Consult a licensed physician before making health decisions."
Red Flag Detection:
python

def detect_emergency(symptoms):
    if "chest pain" in symptoms or "severe bleeding" in symptoms:
        return "EMERGENCY: Call 911 immediately"
Geographic Compliance:
Region-specific drug regulations (FDA, EMA, etc.)
Ayurvedic practice regulations (e.g., only suggest where legally recognized)
4. Technical Stack
Backend:
Python + FastAPI
LLM API integration (OpenAI/Azure)
Vector DB for medical knowledge (Pinecone, Chroma)
Frontend:
React/Flutter for mobile/web
HIPAA-compliant hosting options
Data Pipeline:
Medical knowledge curation workflow
Continuous updates from peer-reviewed journals
5. Development Roadmap
Phase 1 (MVP):
Symptom checker for 20 common conditions
Basic drug recommendations
Emergency detection system
Phase 2:
Ayurvedic module integration
Test recommendation engine
User history tracking
Phase 3:
Telemedicine integration
Multi-language support
Clinical trial matching
6. Ethical Considerations
Bias Mitigation:
Regular audits for demographic biases
Diverse training data representation
Transparency:
Show confidence scores for diagnoses
Cite sources for recommendations
Data Privacy:
HIPAA/GDPR compliance
On-device processing where possible
7. Validation & Testing
Clinical Validation:
Partner with medical institutions for testing
Compare against physician diagnoses
User Testing:
A/B test different recommendation styles
Collect feedback from diverse user groups
8. Monetization Strategy
Freemium model:
Free: Basic symptom checking
Premium: Detailed reports, personalized plans
B2B partnerships with clinics/hospitals
Key Challenges & Solutions:
Challenge: Medical accuracy
Solution: Hybrid approach (LLM + curated knowledge base + physician review)
Challenge: Legal liability
Solution: Clear disclaimers, no prescription generation, emergency detection
Challenge: Ayurvedic validation
Solution: Partner with Ayurvedic institutions, cite classical texts
